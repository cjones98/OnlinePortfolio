		<p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Casey Jones and I am a current graduating Computer Engineering major at Howard University. Before joining Howard University, I was a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland, College Park. My hometown is Baltimore, Maryland. I am a part of the Gates Millenium Scholars program as well as the Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) program at Howard. I am looking to learn new things and apply my knowledge to real-world applications.
