# OnlinePortfolio

Hello!

The main purpose of creating this project was to make a portfolio 
that will display my profile as well as all of my accomplishments,
especially throughout my college career. I start my portfolio project 
with a small introduction of myself, followed by my interests, skills,
and relevant coursework.

This portfolio includes an html file for the content of my webpage as well as a 
css file for the style of my webpage.
